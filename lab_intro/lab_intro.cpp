 * distance away from the center.
 *
 * For example, a pixel 3 pixels above and 4 pixels to the right of the center
 * is a total of `sqrt((3 * 3) + (4 * 4)) = sqrt(25) = 5` pixels away and
 * its luminance is decreased by 2.5% (0.975x its original value).  At a
 * distance over 160 pixels away, the luminance will always decreased by 80%.
